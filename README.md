## Introduce:

Flash loans are unsecured instant loans unique to the DeFi ecosystem, and the entire process is completed in a single transaction on the blockchain. They are executed through smart contracts and are "atomic", meaning that the transaction is either fully completed or not at all, thus preventing losses to the lender. Borrowers can obtain large amounts of funds without collateral, but must repay them in the same transaction block.
