## Introduce:

Flash loans are unsecured instant loans unique to the DeFi ecosystem, and the entire process is completed in a single transaction on the blockchain. They are executed through smart contracts and are "atomic", meaning that the transaction is either fully completed or not at all, thus preventing losses to the lender. Borrowers can obtain large amounts of funds without collateral, but must repay them in the same transaction block.

## Arbitrage process using flash loansï¼š
Identify price discrepancies: The trader identifies that a cryptocurrency is priced differently on two exchanges. For example, ETH might be priced lower on exchange A and higher on exchange B.

(i) Obtain flash loan: The trader applies for a flash loan in the desired cryptocurrency (e.g. ETH).

(ii) Execute trade: They use the borrowed funds to buy the cryptocurrency at a lower price on exchange A and then immediately sell it on exchange B at a higher price.

(iii) Repay loan: The trader then repays the flash loan and associated fees in the same transaction block.

(iv) Profit realization: If successful, the trader keeps the profit, which is the difference between the purchase price and the sale price, minus any transaction and loan fees.
